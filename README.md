# My-RESTful-API
In the project, I use Node.js, Postman and npm express, ejs, mongoose, and body-parser to create Restful API
There are some functions I also would like to highlight:
1) Express.js Route Parameters. https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html
2) Lodash Utility Library. https://lodash.com/
